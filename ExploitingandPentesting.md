# Exploiting and Pentesting using VMware, Kali Purple, Greenbone, and Metasploitable

## Overview

This lab follows up on the Vulnerability Managment lab, as it invovles exploitation and pentesting using VMware, Kali Purple, Greenbone, and Metasploitable involves setting up virtual environments to simulate attacks, identify vulnerabilities, and test security defenses through tools like Kali Purple for proactive offense, Greenbone for vulnerability assessment, and Metasploitable as a target for practicing penetration testing techniques.

## Objective

Use Kali Purple to exploit and penetrate metaploitable and run cmds inside it.

## Technologies Used:

- VMware: Provides the virtualization platform for creating and managing the virtual machines.

- Kali Purple: Used for defensive security operations, including threat detection and incident response.

- Greenbone: Utilized for vulnerability scanning and risk assessment.

- Metasploitable: Provides an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine employed for penetration testing and validating vulnerabilities.

## Scaning for open ports on Metasploitable using 'Nmap'

- Launch VMware and run Kali purple. Open the Terminal and enter 'Nmap'.

- 'Nmap' will show information of open ports in Metasploitable.

- Enter this with Metasploitable's IP address to display a similar list of open ports, but has services associated with specific ports.

'''bash
sudo nmap -sv 

## Final Thoughts and Conclusions


### Achieved Objectives

In this comprehensive guide, we successfully utilized VMware, Kali Purple, Greenbone, and Metasploitable to create a virtualized environment for vulnerability management. The primary objectives were to set up and configure the virtual machines, scan and analyze vulnerabilities using Greenbone, and interpret the results to understand the security posture of Metasploitable. Each step was meticulously executed, ensuring a robust and controlled approach to identifying and mitigating security risks.

### Learning Outcomes

- Virtualization Proficiency: Gained hands-on experience with VMware Workstation for creating and managing virtual environments.

- Defensive Security Operations: Learned to utilize Kali Purple for real-time threat detection and incident response.

- Vulnerability Scanning: Mastered the installation and configuration of Greenbone for comprehensive vulnerability scanning.

- Penetration Testing: Validated vulnerabilities using Metasploitable and understood the importance of testing in a controlled environment.

- Result Interpretation: Developed skills in interpreting vulnerability scan results and identifying remediation steps.


### Real-World Applicability

The skills and knowledge acquired through this guide are directly applicable to real-world scenarios in cybersecurity. Virtual environments provide a safe space to test and refine security measures without risking production systems. The ability to detect and respond to threats in real-time, conduct thorough vulnerability assessments, and perform penetration testing are critical components of an effective cybersecurity strategy. By simulating these processes, we enhance our preparedness for actual security incidents and improve our overall security posture.
