# Exploiting by launching a test DDoS attack on Metasploitable

## Overview

This lab follows up on the Vulnerability Managment lab, as it invovles exploitation and pentesting using VMware, Kali Purple, Greenbone, and Metasploitable involves setting up virtual environments to simulate attacks, identify vulnerabilities, and test security defenses through tools like Kali Purple for proactive offense, Greenbone for vulnerability assessment, and Metasploitable as a target for practicing penetration testing techniques.

## Objective

Use Kali Purple to find exploits and launching a test DDoS attack on Metasploitable.

## Technologies Used:

- VMware: Provides the virtualization platform for creating and managing the virtual machines.

- Kali Purple: Used for defensive security operations, including threat detection and incident response.

- Greenbone: Utilized for vulnerability scanning and risk assessment.

- Metasploitable: Provides an intentionally vulnerable virtual machine employed for penetration testing and validating vulnerabilities.

- msfconsole: This is the primary interface of the Metasploit Framework, accessed through the command line. This allows launching exploits against vulnerable systems, aearch for and load different modules (exploits, payloads, auxiliary modules) and perform various post-exploitation activities.

## Scanning for open/vulnerable ports on Metasploitable using 'Nmap'

- Launch VMware and run Kali purple. Open the Terminal and enter 'Nmap'.

- 'Nmap' will show information of open ports in Metasploitable.

- Enter this cmd to display a similar list of open ports, but has services associated with specific ports and its version. The correct version is important to know for the correct exploit.

      sudo nmap -sv 192.168.xxx.xxx

- Enter this cmd to display a list of ports that have open vulnerable ports.

      sudo nmap 192.168.xxx.xxx --script vuln

- This has information of types of exploits that these open ports are vulnerable to.

- One example is a DDoS attack vulnerability detailed as shown here.

- Refer 'Slowloris DOS attack' as the searchable item.
  
## Using 'msfconsole' to set a DDoS attack to metasploitable

- Open another console terminal on Kali Purple. Enter this cmd:

      msfconsole

- Enter this following cmd to generate a list of exploits available just for Metasploitable.

      msf6 > show exploits
  
- Since the choice of vulnerability exploitation is a DDos Attack, a search must be conducted for it. 

- Enter this cmd to generate information on the specific vulnerability. 

      msf6 > search Slowloris

- After the module pulls up, enter this cmd to use it.

      msf6 > use 0
## Final Thoughts and Conclusions


### Achieved Objectives

In this comprehensive guide, we successfully utilized VMware, Kali Purple, Greenbone, and Metasploitable to create a virtualized environment for vulnerability management. The primary objectives were to set up and configure the virtual machines, scan and analyze vulnerabilities using Greenbone, and interpret the results to understand the security posture of Metasploitable. Each step was meticulously executed, ensuring a robust and controlled approach to identifying and mitigating security risks.

### Learning Outcomes

- Virtualization Proficiency: Gained hands-on experience with VMware Workstation for creating and managing virtual environments.

- Defensive Security Operations: Learned to utilize Kali Purple for real-time threat detection and incident response.

- Vulnerability Scanning: Mastered the installation and configuration of Greenbone for comprehensive vulnerability scanning.

- Penetration Testing: Validated vulnerabilities using Metasploitable and understood the importance of testing in a controlled environment.

- Result Interpretation: Developed skills in interpreting vulnerability scan results and identifying remediation steps.


### Real-World Applicability

The skills and knowledge acquired through this guide are directly applicable to real-world scenarios in cybersecurity. Virtual environments provide a safe space to test and refine security measures without risking production systems. The ability to detect and respond to threats in real-time, conduct thorough vulnerability assessments, and perform penetration testing are critical components of an effective cybersecurity strategy. By simulating these processes, we enhance our preparedness for actual security incidents and improve our overall security posture.
